                <br>Rolanda here! You'll probably find me checking out the latest restaurants featured on blogto or window shopping and wishing I had more money.
                I am pretty adventurous when it comes to food and will try anything as long as it's not alive or spicy. I love exploring new restaurants with 
                my friends and family and watch travel/food vlog videos in my free time. My dream would be to travel the world one day and be able to experience the 
                different cultures and cuisines. I have a lot of places to visit on my bucket list but unfortunately that list needs extensive funding.</br>

                <br>Apart from watching travel/food vlogs and eating my way through downtown Toronto, I also enjoy swimming and hiking. I guess I have to do something
                to burn off all those calories. I enjoy exploring new trails and conservation areas and like being able to step away from the city life and breathe 
                in some fresh air from time to time. </br>

                <br>To leave off on a more serious note, my educational background consists of a Bachelor of Commerce from UofT as well as a Certificate in Business Analysis
                from UofT. I am also currently enrolled in the Web Development Bootcamp at UofT and my goal is to somehow be able to combine all my education and do
            something that I love. </br>
